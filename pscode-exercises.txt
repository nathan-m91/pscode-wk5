// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

If number ends in 1, 3, 5, 7, 9 it = odd
If number ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, 8 it = even

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

PSUEDO CODE
a) Generate 5 random numbers. Assign variable labels for each number. Use num1, num2, num3, num4, num5 as variables
b) Add sum of numbers then divide by 5
c) If num1>num2 compare num2 to num3 else compare num1 to num3. Complete until one num variable is compared to all numbers then print
d) Print result from b with label average of numbers. Print results from c with label smallest
